Overview:
The goal is to build a task management system with three user roles: Admin, Manager, and Regular User. Each user role has specific privileges, and tasks are managed differently based on the user's role. The app will have a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend, with MongoDB as the database. JWT will be used for authentication and role-based access control.

1. Backend Development
1.1. Technology Stack:
Node.js: For backend server logic
Express.js: To build RESTful API endpoints
MongoDB & Mongoose: For database and ORM, handling users, tasks, and roles
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication and authorization
bcrypt.js: For password hashing
1.2. Database Models:
User:
Fields: _id, username, email, password, role (Admin/Manager/Regular), manager (for users assigned to a manager)
Task:
Fields: _id, title, description, dueDate, status (pending, in-progress, completed), createdBy (user ID reference)
1.3. Endpoints:
Authentication:
POST /api/auth/register: Admin creates users (Managers or Regular Users).
POST /api/auth/login: Login with username/password to receive JWT token.
User Management:
GET /api/users: Admin view of all users.
POST /api/users: Admin creates new users.
PUT /api/users/:id: Admin edits user details.
DELETE /api/users/:id: Admin deletes a user.
Task Management:
GET /api/tasks: Get all tasks (Admin), or tasks assigned to users (Manager), or self-tasks (Regular User).
POST /api/tasks: Create a new task.
PUT /api/tasks/:id: Edit a task.
DELETE /api/tasks/:id: Delete a task.
1.4. Role-Based Access Control Middleware:
Middleware to protect routes based on user roles (Admin, Manager, Regular User).
Ensure each route checks user role and allows only authorized actions.
1.5. JWT Authentication:
Protect API routes using JWT, checking token validity and user roles.
Create middleware to verify token and role permissions.
1.6. Task Filtering:
Add query parameters for filtering by status and dueDate in the task routes.
2. Frontend Development
2.1. Technology Stack:
React: Frontend framework
React Router: Role-based routing
Redux or Context API: Global state management (e.g., authentication state)
Axios: To make API requests to the backend
Styled Components/Material UI: For UI components
2.2. Authentication & Routing:
Login Page: Allow users to log in using their credentials, fetch JWT on successful login.
Protected Routes: Use React Router to define role-based routes:
Admin Dashboard: Manage users and view/edit/delete any task.
Manager Dashboard: Manage their tasks and oversee assigned users.
Regular User Dashboard: Manage their own tasks.
2.3. Dashboard Components:
Admin Dashboard:

Create and manage users (Managers and Regular Users).
Assign managers to oversee specific users.
Manage all tasks (view, edit, delete).
Manager Dashboard:

Manage personal tasks.
View and manage tasks of regular users assigned to them.
Regular User Dashboard:

Manage personal tasks (create, edit, delete).
Filter tasks by status or due date.
2.4. Task Management UI:
Task List: Display tasks with filters (status, due date).
Task CRUD UI: Form to create, edit, and delete tasks.
2.5. Global State Management:
Manage authentication state (login/logout) with Redux or Context API.
Store user role in state for role-based rendering.
3. Deployment
3.1. Frontend Deployment:
Deploy the React frontend to Netlify or Vercel for static hosting.
3.2. Backend Deployment:
Deploy the Node.js backend to Heroku or another cloud platform.
4. Version Control
Use Git for version control.
Host the project repository on GitHub.
Add a comprehensive README with instructions on how to run the app locally, including environment variables, backend, and frontend setup.
5. Deliverables:
GitHub Repository: Containing both the frontend and backend code.
README: Instructions on setting up the project, running it locally, and configuring environment variables.
Deployed App (Optional): Link to deployed app on Heroku (backend) and Netlify/Vercel (frontend).
Project Timeline:
Week 1:

Set up project structure (backend and frontend).
Implement user authentication (JWT-based) and role management.
Week 2:

Complete CRUD operations for tasks.
Implement role-based middleware and task filtering.
Week 3:

Build frontend (React), dashboard views, and task management.
Set up protected routes based on roles (Admin, Manager, Regular User).
Week 4:

Final testing, debugging, and deployment.
Update README with instructions.
Additional Notes:
For scalability, you may consider integrating role management using tools like RBAC or Passport.js, if needed.
The design and UI can be enhanced by leveraging UI frameworks like Material UI for a consistent user experience.
